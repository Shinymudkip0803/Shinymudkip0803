## What This Project Does

This folder is a **Quarto Book Project**. With a single command, it renders your research report into two professional outputs simultaneously:

| Output | What It Produces | Where It Goes |
|---|---|---|
| 🌐 **Website** | A multi-page, navigable site | `docs/` folder → GitHub Pages |
| 📄 **PDF** | A single print-ready document | `docs/` folder → submit to Blackboard |

You write your content **once** in plain text (`.qmd` files). Quarto handles the formatting for both outputs automatically.

## Before You Start: One-Time Setup

Complete these steps **once** before you write anything.

### Step 1 — Place your data file

Copy your `coding_data_clean.RDS` file (produced in Data Wrangling [R]) into this project folder — the same level as `_quarto.yml`.

> **Where is my .RDS file?** In RStudio, you saved it with:
> `saveRDS(coding_data, "coding_data_clean.RDS")`
> It is wherever your RStudio Project was set at the time.

### Step 2 — Open as an RStudio Project

1. In RStudio: **File → Open Project**
2. Navigate to this folder and open `mc451-final-project.Rproj`

> **Don't see an .Rproj file?** Create one: **File → New Project → Existing Directory** → select this folder.

### Step 3 — Install required R packages

In the RStudio Console, run:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",
  "knitr",
  "kableExtra",
  "scales"
))
```

### Step 4 — Get the APA citation style file

Follow the instructions in `GET-APA-CSL.txt` to download `apa.csl` into this folder. Then delete `GET-APA-CSL.txt`.

### Step 5 — Update `_quarto.yml`

Open `_quarto.yml` and change these three lines:

```yaml
title: "Your Actual Study Title: A Content Analysis of X Coverage of Y"
author: "Your Full Name"
repo-url: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME
```

---

## How to Write Your Report

Each `.qmd` file is one chapter/page of your report. Open them in order and follow the instructions inside. Every file contains:

- 🟩 **Green instruction comments** (`<!-- like this -->`) — read them, then delete them before your final render
- **[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]** — replace with your actual content
- **`← replace` comments in R code chunks** — swap variable names for your real column names

### The writing order we recommend:

1. `02-methodology.qmd` — easiest starting point; draws directly from your Codebook and Sampling Plan
2. `01-introduction.qmd` — expand your Prospectus; add theory from Annotated Manuscript
3. `03-results.qmd` — paste your .RDS file in and update variable names; let the code run
4. `04-discussion.qmd` — interpret your Results; answer the RQs
5. `index.qmd` — write the Abstract last, once everything else is done

### Working with R code chunks in the Results chapter

The `03-results.qmd` file contains pre-written R code. The **only changes you need to make** are:

1. Replace `var1` with your first variable's column name (e.g., `tone`)
2. Replace `var2` with your second variable's column name (e.g., `source_type`)
3. Update chart titles, axis labels, and figure captions to describe your actual variables
4. Adjust the color palette if you have more or fewer categories than the defaults

> **To see what your column names are**, run this in the RStudio Console:
> `names(readRDS("coding_data_clean.RDS"))`

---

## Rendering: From Files to PDF + Website

### Test render (do this often while writing)

In the RStudio Terminal tab (not the Console), run:

```bash
quarto render
```

This generates everything in the `docs/` folder. Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to preview the website. Open `docs/Study-Title.pdf` (or similar name) to check the PDF.

### If the render fails

The most common issues and fixes:

| Error Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `object 'var1' not found` | You have not replaced the placeholder variable name in a code chunk |
| `cannot open file 'coding_data_clean.RDS'` | The .RDS file is not in the project folder |
| `citation 'CITATION' not found` | The `@CITATION` key in your text does not match any entry in `references.bib` |
| `apa.csl not found` | You have not completed Step 4 above |
| Package not found | Run `install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME")` in the Console |

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

### First time: Create your repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click **New Repository**
3. Name it `mc451-portfolio` (or any name you prefer)
4. Set it to **Public**
5. Do **not** initialize with a README (you already have files)
6. Click **Create Repository**

### Connect your project to GitHub

In the RStudio Terminal:

```bash
# Initialize git (only needed once)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit — MC 451 Final Portfolio"

# Connect to your GitHub repo (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mc451-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top menu) → **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select: **Deploy from a branch**
4. Branch: `main` | Folder: `/docs`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 2–3 minutes, then visit:
   `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/mc451-portfolio/`

### After making changes

Every time you edit your report:

```bash
quarto render
git add .
git commit -m "Update: brief description of what you changed"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will update your live site within ~2 minutes of each push.

---

## Updating Your Citations (`references.bib`)

### Export from Zotero (recommended)

1. In Zotero, select all sources you want to cite
2. **Right-click → Export Items**
3. Format: **BibTeX**
4. Save as `references.bib` — **replace** the existing file in this folder

### Cite in your text

| What You Type | What Appears |
|---|---|
| `[@Entman1993]` | (Entman, 1993) |
| `[@Entman1993, p. 52]` | (Entman, 1993, p. 52) |
| `@Entman1993` | Entman (1993) |
| `[@Entman1993; @McCombs1972]` | (Entman, 1993; McCombs, 1972) |

The citation key (e.g., `Entman1993`) is whatever appears after the `@` at the start of each entry in your `.bib` file. Zotero generates these automatically.

## What to Submit on Blackboard

By **Friday, May 8, 2026 at 11:59 pm**, submit both:

1. **PDF file** — located at `docs/[Your-Title].pdf` after rendering
   - Rename it: `Lastname_FinalPortfolio.pdf`
   - Upload this file to the Blackboard submission

2. **Live URL** — your GitHub Pages address
   - Format: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/mc451-portfolio/`
   - Paste this URL directly into the Blackboard submission text box

> ⚠️ **Test your URL in a private/incognito browser window before submitting.** Confirm the site is public, all pages load, and all figures render. A broken or private link is treated the same as a missing submission.
