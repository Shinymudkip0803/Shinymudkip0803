**Approach Used:** Connector

## Your Reflection

This semester seems like it is gearing up to be a lot of reading for all of my courses. MC-451 seems like we will be doing a lot of reading for research. Whereas some of my other courses, like MC-403, have a book that we are required to read for the material. I am, however, excited to be able to get into the actual content of the courses and hope I will be able to link the skills and knowledge I gain from both this course and MC-402 and use them to improve my website that I had built last semester in Web Design. I think that this course will help me improve the layout and design of the site, whereas MC-402 will help in marketing and getting my site to be seen by potential employers or people of interest. The website I currently have is basic in design and does not have many projects or other things to display quite yet. We will see if the courses help improve my website, but I believe that it will as long as I remember to update it.
This Semester is also the last one before I am able to apply for the Master's Program here, specifically the Media Studies Degree. So, I am hoping that this course helps me get started with learning what is expected and how to properly research Media related topics and fields. All in all, I am excited for the new semester and can not wait to see how it progresses.
